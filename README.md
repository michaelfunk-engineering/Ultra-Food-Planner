Goals:
  * Weekly Foodplan in the style of calendar
  * Auto genarate Weekly Shopping List
  * Calculate macro nutrition values from recipes
  * Recipe-Database with Community Functions
  * Food Storage to avoid double-buying if the foog is already at home

Nice To-Haves: 
  * Smart Proposal for Recipes from already purchased Food to "Auto-Complete" Weekly Plan
  * include Nutrition Goals into the algorithm
  * scrape Supermarkets for their packaging size and prizes to give a receommendation
  * include sale offers into that search
